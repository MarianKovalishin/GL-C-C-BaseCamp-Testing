There is a problem with system files such a "System Volume Information" folder,
so I decided to skip all "unpredictable" files/folders and start searching not from "C:\",
but from "C:/folder_for_searching/". Here I`ll put folders and files, that I need to find.
Also, I am very sorry for not full answer. I had a very important things to do in real life
and I just didn`t have enough time to finish this with static library and threads.
